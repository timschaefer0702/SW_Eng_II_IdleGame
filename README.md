The Idle Game is written in Java and Thread-based. The goal is to make as much money as possible in a defined time format.
To do that the player has to produce ___ by using production machines. the producion machines produce one dedicated product in every time frame
To make money off these products, they have to be sold, which is done by a seller. in every time frame the seller sells one product and cashes its profits and the 
money is added to the player balance. with this balance the player is able to upgrade the machines or sellers or buy entire new machines or sellers.

The player controls this by console commands e.g.:
account --> the current account balance is shown
machines --> all of the current machines and their levels are shown
upgrade machine "yxz" --> if the player has the currency to afford the upgrade the corresponding machine is upgraded.
